Axion 1.4 Build
2025/05/20

• add some condition to the code

• munch: provide ota for unofficial axion build

• munch: overlay: Disable intrusive gms components
* these processes were not allowed to run in background and yet they still persist everytime causing logspam and unnecessary broadcast, we may want to disable "GmsIntentOperationService" but some users on xda reported broken notifications on stuffs like google keep and maybe other google apps that relies on GmsIntentOperationService broadcasts.

• munch: Disable logging sensors-hal events
This sets log_level to 0
This is done especially to disable spammy logging of ambient light sensor events

• munch: props: Clean up useless logspams

• munch: Disable kpti
* As per qualcomm - SM8150/SM8250/SM8350/SM7250/SM7150/SM6150 - KPTI Not required.
* It can also help increase performance by a lot in some scenarios.

• munch: Disable game default frame rate feature
* This feature was enabled by default on Android 15 and limits the
  refresh rate to 60FPS in some games. Disabling it allows games to use
  any refresh rate without restrictions.

• munch: Silence some spammy logging
HWC and cit sensor logspam is so intense it bumps up logd's idle CPU
usage up to over 3%. With this change, logs are much cleaner and logd
idle CPU usage is reduced to under 1%, while still allowing error logs
to pass through.
- Do this only in user/debug builds (except eng).
- Add wifi and cnss too while we're at it, they can get noisy at times.
