- Remove unnecessary QTI logkit directories
 * We do not use logkit

- Update pinner configuration
 * Pin critical graphics libraries

   Inspired from AOSPA/android_vendor_aospa@c33cdcb

- Enable 64-bit inode version support for ext4
 * https://jtlayton.wordpress.com/2016/12/16/the-inode-i_version-counter-in-linux/

- Speed profile services and wifi-service to reduce RAM and storage

- Limit AOD & Ambient Display refresh rate to 60Hz 

- Enable display async powermode
 * All xiaomi sm8250 devices have it enabled in stock.

- Add some libraries to pinner list
 * Add some librart which will load during camera launch to reduce camera
   launch time in I/O busy case.

- Frameworks: Update pinner configuration
 * Drop unused 32-bit libs.
   Drop RS libs as they're deprecated since 12.
   Add few adreno (EGL) libs, taken from MIUI.
   Add libipebpsstriping170 for yupik camx.

- Reduce aod brightness value from 17 to 12

- props: Clean up useless logspams

- Disable logging sensors-hal events

   10-14 14:17:17.674 14629 14629 I sensors-hal: get_system_config:67, log_level: 0

   This is done especially to disable spammy logging of ambient light sensor events
   10-14 14:17:12.821 12603 14590 I sensors-hal: handle_ambient_light_event:157, _ambient_light: ts=3858719100254, lux=11, data_c=0, delta_ms=0, data_cnt=0

- Provide thermal profile permissions

- Disable kpti
 * As per qualcomm - SM8150/SM8250/SM8350/SM7250/SM7150/SM6150 - KPTI Not required.
 * It can also help increase performance by a lot in some scenarios.
 
- Move DPM feature property to /system_ext
 * DPM blobs are under /system_ext.

- Disable DRC
 * DRC is audio policy to 'compress' volume table, which causes low max volume. Disable it for now

- disable proximity usage during doze

- Address more denials

- Don't pin some adreno libs
 * they can't be anyways pinned until system_server selinux access
 * avc:  denied  { read } for  name="libgpudataproducer.so" dev="dm-4" ino=1081 scontext=u:r:system_server:s0
 * avc:  denied  { read } for  name="libgpudataproducer.so" dev="dm-4" ino=1799 scontext=u:r:system_server:s0
 * avc:  denied  { read } for  name="libipebpsstriping.so" dev="dm-4" ino=1819 scontext=u:r:system_server:s0

- Label nr_requests
 * W init    : type=1400 audit(0.0:46): avc:  denied  { write } for  name="nr_requests" dev="sysfs" ino=70247 scontext=u:r:init:s0

- Address no fingerprint denials
 * W init    : type=1400 audit(0.0:55): avc:  denied  { mounton } for  path="/vendor/etc/permissions/android.hardware.wifi.aware.xml" dev="dm-4" ino=632 scontext=u:r:init:s0 tcontext=u:object_r:vendor_configs_file:s0 tclass=file permissive=0

     -----  following are wifi related changes ----
 
- Increase max bss count
 * QCOM's driver can support a max of 512 scan results. Ensure that
   wpa_supplicant is in sync with that number.

- Disable RX wakelock feature
- Relax WiFi re-association RSSI thresholds
- No BSS flush for 2018 devices
- Disable TDLS offchannel
 * TDLS off-channel feature is needed only for
   certification. Disable the feature in production
   builds.

- Remove entry for gEnableNUDTracking
 * Currently Min, Max and default values of gEnableNUDTracking in
     code are:
     Min: 0 (Driver will not track the NUD failures, and ignore the same)
     Max: 2 (Driver will track the NUD failures and if honoured will roam
	away from the connected BSSID to a new BSSID to retain the
	data connectivity).
     Default: 2
 
     In order to enable NUD tracking after NUD failure by default,
     remove entry for gEnableNUDTracking from ini file.

- Remove TxPower2g and 5g
 * Ini config values TxPower2g and TxPower5g are not
   getting used anymore.
   Remove TxPower2g and TxPower5g from WCNSS_qcom_cfg.ini
   for all the targets.

- set inactivity time
 * Wait for 1 second to let wifi driver do
   complete clean reset of SW/HW.

- Bind mount Wifi Aware feature permissions.
 * Fixes issues when GPS and Wifi are switched on simultaneously.
   * Also kills logspam regarding NAN.

- Extend gInterfaceChangeWait to 2 seconds for avoid crash when "adb reboot"





Changelogs For AxionAOSP v1.3 BETA Update
Build Date: 12/04/2025

- Cleanup OMX Dependencies for latest sources
- sepolicy: Remove duplicate snxxx AIDL rules
 * These are now part of qcom/sepolicy_vndr.

- These are now part of qcom/sepolicy_vndr.
 * NfcNci and SecureElement are built by handheld_system.mk

- Implant bypass charging and address appropriate sepolicy rules
 * thanks @Rve27 for the kernel side work

- Resolving AxionOS Kernel Tuning/Performance Mode Denials and address SELinux denials for VM tuning
- Address more sepolicy 
 * Resolve mediacodec denials
 * Allow mdm_helper to use fowner capability
 * allow usbd binder call
 * Address schedtune denials
 * allow vendor_init to read fingerprint_data_file

- Moving some properties from vendor.prop to system.prop to make selinux happy 
 * ro.hwui.render_ahead
 * persist.mm.enable.prefetch
 * ro.config.avoid_gfx_accel
 * property=persist.radio.NO_STAPA
 * property=persist.radio.VT_HYBRID_ENABLE
 * persist.radio.dynamic_sar

- Move rild.libpath to system prop and set it manually
 * Nuked from init.qcom.rc

- Remove unexported property triggers from rootdir
- Resolve GNSS denial
- Tetheroffload: Version 1.1
- Build vendor.display.config@1.9
 * getTransport: Cannot find entry vendor.display.config@1.9::IDisplayConfig/default in either framework or device VINTF manifest.

   [ERROR][FORMAT ] camxdisplayconfig.cpp:124 Initialize() IDisplayConfig service is NULL, version 1.9

- Manually place msm_drm and msm_kgsl_3d0 IRQs
 * After unbalancing, move these IRQs to separate cores to improve latency.

- Set LTE+ threshold bandwidth to 0
 * so LTE+ icon will show whenever it's available

- Set 5G threshold bandwidth to 0
 * So that 5G+ icon will show whenever it's available

- Compact cached app heaps in the background
 * Background ART heap compaction for cached apps has been
   recommended for Android Go devices for a while, and Google has enabled it for
   the Pixel 5 on RQ1A.201205.010. This feature should help fit more cached apps
   in memory

- Rm package cache on early boot
 * Because Android won't do it on a dirty flash so certain elements will be broken if something is changed in UI.

- Disable turbulence noise
- Offload WM shell to another thread
 * Reduces jitter/jank when pulling down shade

- Disable debug.sf.latch_unsignaled
 *  debug.sf.latch_unsignaled - This causes SurfaceFlinger to latch   buffers
 even if their fences haven't signaled

 * Disabling this helps reduces notification QS lag, UI performance is not impacted.

  - Unicote:
    Also fixes live wallpapers lags

- Increase max fling velocity
 * Allow scrolling faster, corresponding to our reduced scroll friction.

- Give proper permissions for /dev/diag
 * This gives proper permission to /dev/diag node so that diag driver can load successfully

   Before in log:
   Diag_Lib:  Diag_LSM_Init: Failed to open handle to diag driver, error = 13

   After in log:
   Diag_Lib: qpLogDiagInit <== result : 1
   Diag_Lib: QMID : gIsQXDMDisabled 0, gIsADBDisabled 1, gIsDebugDisabled
   0, gIsIMSLogsDisabled 0

-  Silence some spammy logging
 * HWC and cit sensor logspam is so intense it bumps up logd's idle CPU
   usage up to over 3%. With this change, logs are much cleaner and logd
   idle CPU usage is reduced to under 1%, while still allowing error logs
   to pass through.
   - Do this only in user/debug builds (except eng).

- Disable Chimera.GmsIntentOperationService and Disable collective Device administrators GMS components
 * Inspired from universal gms doze magisk module.

- Disable adsprpcd_sensorspd.daemon
 * 69 spamming error in logs

- Move gamebar to system settings and add icon as well
- Move to M3 switch for gamespace2.0

- Comming back to lineage-libperfmgr from pixel-libperfmgr
